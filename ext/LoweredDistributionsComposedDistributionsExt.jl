    LoweredDistributionsComposedDistributionsExt

Lower a composed distribution to a backend-agnostic dynamical-systems
representation (a `LoweredDistributions.AbstractLowering`), so
`lower(compose(...))` yields a phase-type or continuous-time Markov chain for
the whole composed delay structure that a downstream Catalyst / ODE / Petri /
Jump backend can consume.

Hosted here rather than in ComposedDistributions itself (the hub-owned
decision, #22): the Spec/generator knowledge the composer methods of `lower`
need is LoweredDistributions' domain, so this extension reads ComposedDistributions'
public composer types and reports back through `lower` rather than the other
way round. Composition of phase-types is closed under the algebra, so the
scalar composers lower exactly:

  - `lower(::Sequential)` convolves the step lowerings into one series phase-type
    (the steps run back to back, so phase `i`'s exit feeds phase `i + 1`).
  - `lower(::Resolve)` mixes the outcome lowerings into a hyper-phase-type
    weighted by the branch probabilities (cause and timing independent).
  - `lower(::Compete)` races the cause-specific lowerings through a
    competing-risks generator (the Kronecker sum, so absorption is the first
    exit, i.e. the minimum).
  - `lower(::Shared)` is transparent: a tie is a parameter-sharing annotation
    with no effect on the dynamics, so it lowers its wrapped leaf.

The two vector-valued composers have no single scalar time to absorption, so
they lower to a `CTMC` over a joint state space rather than a phase-type:

  - `lower(::Parallel)` runs the branches jointly and independently, so its
    generator is the Kronecker sum of the branch generators over the product
    state space.
  - `lower(::Choose)` activates exactly one alternative, chosen externally by
    the selector, so its generator is the block-diagonal union of the
    alternative generators.

A composer whose branches are themselves `Parallel` or `Choose` cannot be folded
into a phase-type (those lower to a joint `CTMC` over several states, whose
vector or conditional meaning is not a scalar delay), so nesting one inside a
scalar composer raises a clear error rather than a silent misrepresentation.
