# The adaptive phase-type fit. Supersedes CensoredDistributions.jl's
# `_moment_stage` (which threw for an over-dispersed c² > 1 leaf): the c² ≤ 1
# branch delegates straight to `compartment_stages`'s moment matching (so that
# fit is not duplicated), and c² > 1 gets a genuine phase-type fit instead of
# an error.

"""
Adaptively fit a phase-type representation to `d` by matching its first two
moments.

Under-dispersed or exactly-dispersed (`c² = var(d) / mean(d)² ≤ 1`) delays fit
an [`ErlangChain`](@ref) exactly on the mean (the same moment match
[`compartment_stages`](@ref) performs). Over-dispersed delays (`c² > 1`) fit a
two-phase hyperexponential [`PhaseType`](@ref) (a mixture of two Exponentials)
by the balanced-means method: with `p = (1 + sqrt((c² - 1) / (c² + 1))) / 2`,
rates `λ₁ = 2p / mean(d)` and `λ₂ = 2(1 - p) / mean(d)` give a mixture with
`p`/`1 - p` phase weights that matches `mean(d)` and `c²` exactly. A sequential
chain (an [`ErlangChain`](@ref) or [`Coxian`](@ref)) cannot reach `c² > 1` —
only a branching (mixture) structure can, hence the different representation.

# Examples

```@example
using LoweredDistributions, Distributions

phase_type(Gamma(2.5, 1.0))     # c² = 0.4 ≤ 1 -> ErlangChain
phase_type(Gamma(0.5, 1.0))     # c² = 2 > 1   -> PhaseType (hyperexponential)
```

# See also

  - [`ErlangChain`](@ref), [`PhaseType`](@ref): the two representations this
    returns.
  - [`lower`](@ref): dispatches here for the over-dispersed case.

# The canonical PhaseType of an Erlang chain fitted to `(m, scv)`, built
# directly rather than via `compartment_stages`/`ErlangChain`: `ChainStage`
# stores its rate in a concrete `Float64` field, which is deliberate for the
# structural chain representation but is a wall for an AD dual. Going straight
# to `(α, S)` keeps the element type of `m`, so this branch differentiates.
# `k` is the same `round(1 / c²)` moment match `compartment_stages` performs,
# so the fitted chain has the same shape. The rate is recomputed from the
# moments (`k / m`) rather than read off an exact leaf's scale (`1 / θ`), so
# for an exact Exponential/Erlang the two can differ in the last ulp; they
# agree to floating-point tolerance, which the equivalence tests check.
#
# The one thing this form costs that `ErlangChain` does not: an explicit
# `k x k` sub-generator. An `ErlangChain` stores the same chain in a single
# `ChainStage` (`k` as an `Int`), so its memory does not grow with `k` at all,
# whereas `S` here is dense and `k` scales as `1 / c²` — a tight delay
# (`Normal(5, 0.001)`, `c² = 4e-8`) asks for 25 million phases and would
# exhaust memory before it ever returned. `max_phases` turns that into an
# actionable error instead of an `OutOfMemoryError`; a caller who genuinely
# wants a huge chain can raise it.
