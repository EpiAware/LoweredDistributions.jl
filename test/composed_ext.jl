# ComposedDistributions × LoweredDistributions extension (hosted here per the
# hub-owned decision, #22/#51): the composer methods of `lower` build the
# phase-type / CTMC of a composed delay structure. The scalar composers lower
# to a phase-type whose absorption-time moments are checked against the
# composition (series adds means and variances, a mixture is the
# probability-weighted mixture, competing risks is the minimum). The vector
# composers lower to a joint CTMC whose generator is validated by the
# constructor and whose transition matrix is stochastic.
